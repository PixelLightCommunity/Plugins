- Added Visual Studio 2011 project files to make it possible to build and debug the project at least a little bit easier
  -> Additional CMake files would be a good idea, have a look at e.g. the dungeon demo to get the idea how this works
- Removed Berkelium includes, better to have the external dependencies completely separated from the own project to avoid version and platform conflicts

- Added a method for the user to check if a page has loaded.
- Some small changes where made to prevent naming conflicts between PLBerkelium and PLAwesomium, should someone decide to run both plugins in one project.
  (Perhaps for a future benchmark project of some sort)

- For preview purposes i am releasing the plugin to the repository, there are however big features that still need to be implemented and or tweaked (buffer update stuff, keyboard control events).
  An usage example will be added to the Examples repository.
  Documentation on functions and usage will be added when the plugin is nearing completion.
