- "SRPWindow::CreateVertexBuffer()" now calls "SRPWindow::UpdateVertexBuffer()" to fill the vertex buffer
  (no duplicated code, easier to maintain)
- "SRPWindow::UpdateVertexBuffer()": Just update the content of the vertex buffer, no need to recreate the whole resource
- "SRPWindow::CreateVertexBuffer()": Added a color vertex attribute, which was never used
- "SRPWindow::CreateVertexBuffer()": Vertex position had 3 components, but only 2 components were used
- "SRPWindow::Initialize()" allocated a vertex buffer, texture buffer and program instance, but never freed the memory

- Bugfix "Gui": The memory of "m_pWindows", "m_pTextButtonHandler" and "m_pKeyButtonHandler" was not freed
- When debugging, "SRPWindow::DestroyBerkeliumWindow()" -> "delete m_pBerkeliumWindow" caused a sudden program
  termination without being able to close the application in a clean way. "Berkelium::Window::~Window()" states:
  "\deprecated Use destroy() to avoid interference from custom allocators.". Review this.

- Renamed the SRPWindows class to SRPWindow, to prevent confusion because that class only manages one window.
- Changed some destruction approaches in Gui and SRPWindow.
- Added some more comment to clarify certain choices.
  -> Throughout the source i commented the things that need to be looked at or subject to change with to following structure /*COMMENT*/.
     This means you can simple search for '/*' to find points of interest.
     There are probably better ways of doing that but for now it is acceptable.

- Added Visual Studio 2011 project files to make it possible to build and debug the project at least a little bit easier
  -> Additional CMake files would be a good idea, have a look at e.g. the dungeon demo to get the idea how this works
- Removed Berkelium includes, better to have the external dependencies completely separated from the own project to avoid version and platform conflicts

- Added a method for the user to check if a page has loaded.
- Some small changes where made to prevent naming conflicts between PLBerkelium and PLAwesomium, should someone decide to run both plugins in one project.
  (Perhaps for a future benchmark project of some sort)

- Added comments to source so that its more easier to understand certain structural choices in methods.

- For preview purposes i am releasing the plugin to the repository, there are however big features that still need to be implemented and or tweaked (buffer update stuff, keyboard control events).
  An usage example will be added to the Examples repository.
  Documentation on functions and usage will be added when the plugin is nearing completion.
