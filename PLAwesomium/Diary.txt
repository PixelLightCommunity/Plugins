 - Warnings that i am not sure about
   -> "SRPWindows::~SRPWindows()" warning C4150: deletion of pointer to incomplete type 'PLRenderer::FragmentShader'; no destructor called
   -> "SRPWindows::~SRPWindows()" warning C4150: deletion of pointer to incomplete type 'PLRenderer::VertexShader'; no destructor called

- "SRPWindow::CreateVertexBuffer()" now calls "SRPWindow::UpdateVertexBuffer()" to fill the vertex buffer
  (no duplicated code, easier to maintain)
- "SRPWindow::UpdateVertexBuffer()": Just update the content of the vertex buffer, no need to recreate the whole resource
- "SRPWindow::CreateVertexBuffer()": Removed a color vertex attribute, which was never used
- "SRPWindow::CreateVertexBuffer()": Vertex position had 3 components, but only 2 components were used
- "SRPWindow::Initialize()" allocated a vertex buffer, texture buffer and program instance, but never freed the memory
- "SRPWindow::CreateProgramWrapper()": Lookout! When creating a program, it only internally saves the pointer to the given
  shaders, but does not take over the shader resource control. You need to destroy the shaders if you no longer need them.
  -> This is something I changed in the new renderer system I am currently working on. In there, I now use reference counter
     to make the usage of the resources easier and to avoid such situations I just fixed.
- "SRPWindow": If you don't need to cache a pointer, don't do it. In case of "m_pImageBuffer = m_cImage.GetBuffer()->GetData()"
  you already have the nice image class as part of your class and don't need to care about memory management. Requesting the
  pointer to the internal data is fast and this way you're on the safe side in case the image was changed and the internal data
  had to be recreated. With this approach, you also have on pointer less you have to heavily document.
- The "ARGBtoRGBA_GLSL.h" content does not need to be visible to the whole project, keep your header lightweight

- Bugfix "Gui": The memory of "m_pWindows", "m_pTextButtonHandler" and "m_pKeyButtonHandler" was not freed

- Renamed the SRPWindows class to SRPWindow, to prevent confusion because that class only manages one window.
- Added some more comment to clarify certain choices.
  -> Throughout the source i commented the things that need to be looked at or subject to change with to following structure /*COMMENT*/.
     This means you can simple search for '/*' to find points of interest.
     There are probably better ways of doing that but for now it is acceptable.
- Their are some changes i made in PLBerkelium that still need to be mirrored back to PLAwesomium since they use a lot of the same features.
  So expect those changes to be made to PLAwesomium as-well.
  -> Some features will not be finalized until Awesomium releases their RC2 version (which will be within the next weeks).

- Added Visual Studio 2011 project files to make it possible to build and debug the project at least a little bit easier
  -> Additional CMake files would be a good idea, have a look at e.g. the dungeon demo to get the idea how this works
- Removed Awesomium includes, better to have the external dependencies completely separated from the own project to avoid version and platform conflicts

- Most of the features for PLAwesomium are now implemented, form objects with pop-up such as drop-down menus need to be looked at.
- Keyboard input is also not yet implemented because the current methods as proposed in PLBerkelium are not sufficient.

- Initial creation of PLAwesomium
- Because Awesomium 1.7 RC1 has been released (http://support.awesomium.com/discussions/announcements/159-awesomium-17-rc1-just-released)
  proper C++ support for VS2010 trough their API finally makes it a viable choice to implement Awesomium into a PixelLight plugin as-well.
  Updates in Awesomium are differently handled then they are in Berkelium therefor the structure of the plugin has to be altered,
  this is why its a wise choice to have 2 separate plugins for these libraries.
