- For preview purposes i am releasing the plugin to the repository, there are however big features that still need to be implemented and or tweaked (buffer update stuff, keyboard control events).
  An usage example will be added to the Examples repository.
  Documentation on functions and usage will be added when the plugin is nearing completion.
